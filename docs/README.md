# fulibWorkflows Documentation

Welcome to the official fulibWorkflows documentation. 
You can learn how to define workflows, create workflow views and generate a basic application from your defined workflow.
In the [Quickstart](quickstart/README.md) area you can find a less detailed HowTo guide.
For further definitions look at [Definitions](definitions/README.md).
