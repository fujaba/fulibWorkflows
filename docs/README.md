# Introduction

Welcome to the official fulibWorkflows documentation. 

You can learn how to define workflows, create workflow views and generate a basic implementation from your workflow.
To learn about the basic usage look at the tutorials found at [Quickstart](quickstart/README.md).

The basic implementation uses plain html for views and Java Spark for communication between services.
