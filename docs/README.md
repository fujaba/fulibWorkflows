# Introduction

Welcome to the official fulibWorkflows documentation. 

You can learn how to define workflows, create workflow views and generate a basic implementation from your workflow.

The basic implementation uses plain html for views and Java Spark for communication between services.

The specific syntax definitions of the events you can find at [Definitions](definitions/README.md).
