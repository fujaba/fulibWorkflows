# Limitations
Due to the current description logic there are limitations to the syntax.

## Value limitations
Values can either be a string or an integer.

## Blocked keys
Special strings that are used as identifiers in the description are not allowed to use as keys in event and data notes.
These consist of the following strings:

- workflow, page, externalSystem, service, command, policy, user, problem 
- event, data 
- pageName, text, input, password, button, value, targetPage
