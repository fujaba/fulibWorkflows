# Definitions

With fulibWorkflows you have the possibility to model different use cases.

## General
There are a few definitions that are used to structure the generated html file. These do not have any functionality in the generated implementation besides the name of a few files.

## Service
Using the event definitions found in [Service](service.md) you can build workflows for one or multiple services.

## GUI
It is also possible to generate very basic plain html guis using the events defined in [GUI](gui.md).

## Model
Furthermore, it is possible to define Classes and Objects for data that will be used in the implementation.
The classes will be generated via [fulib](https://github.com/fujaba/fulib), further details on class generation events can be found in [Model](model.md).
