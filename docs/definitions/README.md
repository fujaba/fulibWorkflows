# Definitions
With fulibWorkflows you have the possibility to model different workflows with 
their primary focus on gui, model or the general workflow.

# General
In general, you can find events as described by Alberto Brandolini's `Event Storming`. 
Besides those you can find a few additional events added for the proper display/generation.

# GUI
It is also possible to generate very basic plain html guis using the events defined in [GUI](gui.md).

# Model
Furthermore, it is possible to define objects via the `data` event to generate object/classdiagrams.
More information can be found in [Model](model.md).
